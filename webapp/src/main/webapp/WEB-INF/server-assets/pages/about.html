            <h3 class="icon icon-generic" data-icon="i">What is BioSamples?</h3>
            <p class="justify">The BioSamples database aggregates sample information for reference samples e.g. Coriell Cell lines and samples for which data exist in one of the EBI's assay databases such as ArrayExpress, the European Nucleotide archive, or Pride. It provides links to assays for specific samples, and accepts direct submissions of samples.</p>

            <p class="justify">The ArrayExpress team is part of the <a href="/about/people/alvis-brazma">Functional Genomics group at EMBL-EBI, led by Alvis Brazma</a>. The team consists of about
                twenty bioinformaticians, ontologists, software engineers and web developers, split between the <a href="/about/people/helen-parkinson">production team led by Helen Parkinson</a> and <a href="/about/people/ugis-sarkans">development team led by Ugis Sarkans</a>. The production team manages, curates and models all incoming data
                to ArrayExpress, while the development team looks after all the back-end database infrastructure and the public-facing website.</p>
