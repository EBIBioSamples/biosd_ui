                <h2>How to submit BioSamples Database</h2>
                
                <p>Submissions to BioSamples Database should be in <a href="st.html">SampleTab file format</a>. This is a tab-separated spreadsheet-like text format compatible with popular office tools.</p>
                
                <p>All of the existing samples in the BioSamples database is avaliable in SampleTab format as examples at <a href="//ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/biosamples/"></a></p>
                
                <p>Once you have a SampleTab file, you can use the <a href="/biosamples/sampletab/validation.html">online validation service</a> to ensure it is correct. This will also apply common corrections and ontology mappings that are used to standardize the data.</p>
                
                <p>You can send the validated and corrrected SampleTab file by email to <a href="mailto:biosamples@ebi.ac.uk">biosamples@ebi.ac.uk</a>. We aim to respond to submissions within one working day.</p>
                
                
                <h3>What is a BioSample?</h3>
                <p>The definition of a BioSample is deliberately flexible in order to accommodate a wide range of uses. Typically each BioSample corresponds to a discrete physical object that is composed of live biological material.</p>
                <p>In most cases BioSample entities are self-evident; such as a blood sample, cell culture or an individual organism. However, a BioSample can also be an environmental sample (e.g. for meta-genomic analysis), a hybrid between two species, parasite infected cell culture, etc.</p>

                <p>Some highly-curated and highly-referenced submissions may become part of the <em>reference layer</em>, for example <a href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107/">ENCODE</a> and <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/">1000 Genomes Project</a>. These are BioSamples that are of significant interest and value.</p>
                        

                <h3>How are BioSamples described?</h3>

                <p>The basic structure for describing BioSamples is an <em>attribute</em> which is composed of a <em>key</em> and a <em>value</em> (a key/value pair), as well as optional modifiers.</p>
                <p>A BioSample is described by a set of attributes. BioSamples are collected together into one or more <em>Groups(s)</em>, which may also have attributes.</p>
                <p>A SampleTab file contains one or more Groups, any BioSamples contained in those groups, and the attributes describing those BioSamples and Groups. A SampleTab file also contains general information, such as contact information and any publications related to the BioSamples.</p>
