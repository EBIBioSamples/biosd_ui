	<description>Approximately one third of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs)
		are characterized by aberrant cytoplasmic localization of
		Nucleophosmin (NPMc+ AML), consequent to mutations in the NPM putative
		nucleolar localization signal. These events are mutually exclusive
		with the major AML-associated chromosomal rearrangements, and are
		frequently associated with normal karyotype, Fms-like tyrosine kinase
		(FLT3) mutations and multilineage involvement. We report the gene
		expression profiles of 78 de novo AMLs (72 with normal karyotype; 6
		with non-major chromosomal abnormalities) that were characterized for
		the subcellular localization and mutation status of NPM. Unsupervised
		clustering clearly separated NPMc+ from NPMc- AMLs, regardless of the
		presence of FLT3 mutations or non-major chromosomal rearrangements,
		supporting the concept that NPMc+ AML represents a distinct entity.
		The molecular signature of NPMc+ AML includes up-regulation of several
		genes putatively involved in the maintenance of a stem cell phenotype,
		suggesting that NPMc+ AML may derive from a multipotent hematopoietic
		progenitor. 78 de novo AMLs, negative for AML-associated chromosomal
		translocations at the cytogenetic and/or molecular level.

	<description>T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and lymphoma
		(T-LBL) share common morphologic and immunophenotypic features and are
		treated with similar therapeutic approaches. Nonetheless, they show
		distinct clinical presentations suggesting that they may represent two
		different biological entities. In order to investigate T-LBL and T-ALL
		biological characteristics we used transcriptional profiling
		approache. Genome-wide gene expression profiling, performed on 20
		T-LBL and 10 T-ALL diagnostic specimens, showed that the two
		malignancies shared a large fraction of their transcriptional profile
		while a subset of genes appeared to be differentially expressed in
		T-LBL versus T-ALL. This gene signature included genes involved in
		chemotactic responses and angiogenesis which might play a role in the
		different tumor cell localization suggesting that T-LBL and T-ALL
		could be two distinct diseases with unique transcriptional
		characteristics. diagnostic bone marrow aspirates from 10 T-ALL and 6

	<description>Gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH1 are common in T-cell
		lymphoblastic leukemias making this receptor a promising target for
		drugs such as gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI), which block a
		proteolytic cleavage required for NOTCH1 activation. However, the
		enthusiasm for these therapies has been tempered by tumor resistance
		and the paucity of information on the oncogenic programs regulated by
		oncogenic NOTCH1. Analysis of gene expression in GSI-responsive and
		GSI-resistant cell lines treated with Compound E identifies
		differential resopnses to GSI. Experiment Overall Design: Samples for
		microarray analysis were prepared and hybridized in Affymetrix Human
		U133 Plus 2.0 arrays according to the manufacturerÃ¢Â&#128;Â&#153;s

	<description>Many human oncogenes are challenging therapeutic targets.
		An alternative to direct targeting of oncogenes is to perform
		â&#128;&#156;synthetic lethalityâ&#128;&#157; screens for genes that
		are essential only in the context of specific cancer-causing
		mutations. We used high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) to identify
		synthetic lethal interactions in cancer cells harboring mutant KRAS,
		the most commonly mutated human oncogene. We find that cells that are
		dependent on mutant KRAS exhibit sensitivity to suppression of the
		serine/threonine kinase STK33 irrespective of tissue origin, whereas
		STK33 is not required by KRAS-independent cells. STK33 promotes cancer
		cell viability in a kinase activity-dependent manner by regulating the
		suppression of mitochondrial apoptosis mediated through S6K1-induced
		inactivation of the death agonist BAD selectively in mutant
		KRAS-dependent cells. These observations identify STK33 as a target
		for treatment of the broad spectrum of mutant KRAS-driven cancers, and
		demonstrate the potential of RNAi screens for discovering critical
		functional dependencies created by oncogenic mutations that may enable
		therapeutic intervention for cancers associated with
		â&#128;&#156;undruggableâ&#128;&#157; genetic alterations. NOMO-1 and
		SKM-1 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were stably transduced with
		different pLKO.1puro lentiviral shRNA vectors targeting STK33 or a
		nontargeting control shRNA. VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral particles
		were produced by cotransfection of 293T cells with pLKO.1 constructs
		and the compatible packaging plasmids pMD.G and pCMVR8.91. Virus was
		harvested 48 and 72 hours after transfection, cells were incubated
		with lentiviral supernatants for 30 hours, and infected cells were
		selected with 2 Âµg/ml puromycin. RNA was isolated after 2 days of
		puromycin selection and isolation of viable cells by density gradient
		centrifugation, and gene expression was profiled using GeneChip Human
		Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix). Fluorescence ratios
		were normalized according to the RMA algorithm, and data were filtered
		as previously described (Bullinger et al. Blood 110:1291-300, 2007)
		using the BRB-ArrayTools software package. For subsequent analyses,
		only probe sets with a p-value for the log intensity variation of less
		than 0.01 were included. Average linkage clustering was used for
		hierarchical clustering (distance measure, correlation uncentered),
		and results were visualized using TreeView (Eisen et al. Proc Natl
		Acad Sci USA 95:14863-14868, 1998). Differentially expressed genes (p
		&lt; 0.005) were identified by â&#128;&#156;class comparison
		analysisâ&#128;&#157; for paired samples (cell line transduced with an
		shRNA targeting STK33 versus cell line transduced with a control
		shRNA) using the BRB-ArrayTools software package (Version 3.3.0
		Beta_3; http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html) and R (Version
		2.2.1; http://www.r-project.org). Screening for an enrichment of genes
		belonging to distinct BioCarta pathways in the different gene sets was
		performed with the BRB Pathway Comparison tool computing several
		statistics, including the Fisher (LS) statistic and the
		Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic. A pathway was considered
		differentially regulated if the significance level was less than

	<description>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease
		from the molecular and biological standpoints, and even patients with
		a specific gene expression profile may present clinical and molecular
		heterogeneity. We studied the epigenetic profiles of a cohort of
		patients that shared a common gene expression profile but differed in
		that only half of them harbored mutations of the CEBPA locus, while
		the rest presented with silencing of this gene and co-expression of
		certain T cell markers. DNA methylation studies revealed that these
		two groups of patients could be readily segregated in an unsupervised
		fashion based on their DNA methylation profiles alone. Furthermore,
		CEBPA silencing was associated with the presence of an aberrant DNA
		hypermethylation signature, which was not present in the CEBPA mutant
		group. This aberrant hypermethylation occurred more frequently at
		sites within CpG islands. CEBPA silenced leukemias also displayed
		marked hypermethylation when compared with normal CD34+ hematopoietic
		cells, while CEBPA mutant cases showed only mild changes in DNA
		methylation when compared to these normal progenitors. Biologically,
		CEBPA silenced leukemias presented with a decreased response to
		myeloid growth factors in vitro. Experiment Overall Design: Direct

	<description>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common

		cases of pediatric ALL carrying the ETV6/RUNX1 (TEL/AML1) fusion gene
		(the most common genetic subtype) and corresponding normal samples. A
		total of 14 somatic mutations were identified, including four and

		mutations (86%) occurred in genes previously described to be mutated
		in other types of cancer, but none was found to be recurrent in an
		extended series of 29 ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALLs. The number of single
		nucleotide mutations was similar to the number of copy number
		alterations as detected by single nucleotide polymorphism arrays.
		Although the true pathogenetic significance of the mutations must
		await future functional evaluations, this study provides a first

	<description>Precise regulation of transduction signaling pathways
		genes is crucial for correct differentiation of kidney cells and
		perturbation may lead to tumor onset. Wilms tumors (WT), or
		nephroblastoma, originates from the metanephric blastema cells, which
		were unable to complete the differentiation, resulting in a triphasic
		tumor composed by distinct cell types, blastemal, epithelial and
		stromal, where the former harbor molecular characteristics similar to
		cells of the earliest stages of kidney development. In this study, to
		identify key early events involved in the disruption of correct cell
		signaling during kidney differentiation that can drive WT, we
		developed a cDNA platform containing genes from signaling transduction
		pathways. By using bioinformatics tools, we defined high conserved
		regions between human and mouse orthologous genes and assessed the
		gene modulation in blastemal cells captured from WT and differentiated
		kidneys (DK) in human and from four temporal stages of kidney
		differentiation in mouse. We found 18 genes, whose transcriptional
		level of the earliest phases of blastemal cell differentiation was
		recapitulated in WT. PAX2, FZD10, SHPK, WNT5B, FZD2, CRABP2, FRZB,
		GRK7, TESK1, HDGF and IGF2 were up- and MAPK9, PIK3CA, FRAT2, ITPR3,
		CDH6, HIPK1 and TIMP3 were down-regulated in WT respectively.
		Hierarchical clustering based on the expression of this gene set
		grouped DK from both species, human and mouse, and discriminated them
		from fetal kidney and WT in human, and the earliest kidney stages in
		mouse, validating the model proposed by this study and reveling a
		transduction signaling signature of WT. High robustness of this data
		was detected since expression level was tested by quantitative RT-PCR
		in the initial and independent sample set, with 75 and 56% of
		agreement. Agreement of 62% was also observed in protein level
		assessing blastemal component of an independent group of 137 WT.
		Protein expression of CRABP2, IGF2, GRK7, TESK1, HDGF, WNT5B, FZD2 and
		TIMP3 was also characterized in human fetal kidneys revealing
		interesting aspects of kidney differentiation. This study identified
		key genes modulated during kidney differentiation which may play a
		determinant role for WT onset. As far as we know, FZD10, FRZB, HDGF,
		MAPK9, FRAT2, SHPK, WNT5B, GRK7, TESK1, HDGF, PIK3CA, ITPR3, HIPK1 and
		TIMP3 were not previously associated to WT. The strong connection
		between nephrogenesis and WT highlights the importance of a detailed
		characterization of modulated genes belonged to signal transduction.
		Identification of gene expression involved in kidney differentiation
		arresting might be imperative to point out early alterations that
		drive WT onset and consequently are potential candidate as molecular
		marker. Here, we characterized expression pattern of genes belonged to
		transduction signaling pathways in blastemal cells during kidney
		development stages in mouse and WT in human. For that, we established
		a model of inter- and intra-specific hybridization to assess gene
		expression modulation to identify key events that drive WT onset.
		Dye-swap was performed for each sample as control for dye bias and
		used as replicate. In total, 24 frozen favorable histology WT and
		differentiated kidney samples were laser microdisscted for blastemal
		cells. Three kidneys from CD1 lineage from Mus Musculus were isolated
		from embryos (E) and postnatal animals (P) at ages E15.5, E17.5, P1.5
		and P7.5 for laser microdissection of the blastemal cells in all
		stages of kidney differentiation. NA were purified with
		PicoPureâ&#132;¢ RNA Isolation kit (Arcturus Engineering #KT0204) and
		treated with RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen #79254; Qiagen-Germantown MD

	<description>Almost a quarter of pediatric patients with Acute
		Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) suffer from relapses. The biological
		mechanisms underlying therapy response and development of relapses
		have remained unclear. In an attempt to better understand this
		phenomenon, we have analyzed 41 matched diagnosis relapse pairs of ALL
		patients using genomeÃ¢Â&#128;Â&#147;wide expression arrays (82
		arrays) on purified leukemic cells. In roughly half of the patients
		very few differences between diagnosis and relapse samples were found
		(Ã¢Â&#128;Â&#156;stable groupÃ¢Â&#128;Â&#157;), suggesting that mostly
		extra-leukemic factors (e.g., drug distribution, drug metabolism,
		compliance) contributed to the relapse. Therefore, we focused our
		further analysis on 20 samples with clear differences in gene
		expression (Ã¢Â&#128;Â&#156;skewed groupÃ¢Â&#128;Â&#157;), reasoning
		that these would allow us to better study the biological mechanisms
		underlying relapsed ALL. After finding the differences between
		diagnosis and relapse pairs in this group, we identified four major
		gene clusters corresponding to several pathways associated with
		changes in cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination and repair, as
		well as B cell developmental genes. We also identified cancer genes
		commonly associated with colon carcinomas and ubiquitination to be
		upregulated in relapsed ALL. Thus, about half of relapses are due to
		selection or emergence of a clone with deregulated expression of a
		genes involved in pathways that regulate B cell signaling,
		development, cell cycle, cellular division and replication. The study
		contains 41 pairs of samples taken from patients at diagnosis and

	<description>In this series we described the gene expression profiles
		of 18 APL patients using a high density DNA-oligonucleotide microarray
		(Agilent) representing about 20.000 genes demonstrating the presence
		of a very uniform expression pattern of APL cases among which two
		mainly types of gene profiles were recognized by unsupervised
		analysis. Relationship between these two subgroups and the different
		clinical, haematological and molecular APL features, comprising FLT3
		status, were investigated. To identify biologically meaningful subsets
		of APL, fluorescently-labelled cRNA was generated by in vitro
		transcription using Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit
		(Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer?s instructions.
		Amplified cRNA of each patient was labelled with cyanine 5-CTP and
		Human Universal Reference (Stratagene) with 3-CTP in each experiment.
		Samples were hybridized on Agilent Human 1A Oligo Microarray (V2),
		ink-jet printed microarray, comprising 20,173 (60-mer) experimentally
		validated oligonucleotide probes (features). Fluorescence data were
		analysed with Feature Extraction Software v.7.5 (Agilent
		Technologies). Log10 ratio of the dye-normalized Cy3 and Cy5 channel
		signals were calculated. Raw signal intensities from each scan were
		imported into the gene expression analysis software Luminator (Rosetta
		Biosoftware). Two-dimensional clustering analysis was performed with
		Rosetta Luminator using an agglomerative algorithm with average link
		heuristics and correlation with mean subtraction. Supervised
		classification of APL samples into categories based on gene expression
		profiles was performed using Bayesian classifier implemented by
		Rosetta Biosoftware. Resultant gene expression profiles were first
		analyzed using an unsupervised, agglomerative hierarchical clustering.
		The matrix view clearly evidenced the high grade of uniformity in gene
		expression pattern among APL patients being the majority of genes
		expressed at high (red colour) or low (green colour) levels relative
		to reference in all APL cases analyzed. This appearance of
		unsupervised matrix reflects the homogeneous nature of acute
		promyelocytic leukemia whose gene expression pattern definitely
		distinguishes it from all other types of acute myeloid leukemia.
		Beside the homogeneous pattern, subtle differences in gene expression
		had the strength to distinguish three clusters of APL patients
		(designed I, II, III). Comparisons between cluster I and cluster II
		patients clearly revealed a preferential distribution of FLT3 gene
		mutated cases in cluster I. Again, cluster I was related to
		microgranular morphology (M3v) (p=0.035) and short-type PML-RAR
		isoform (bcr3) (p=0.044). Furthermore cluster I was significantly
		associated with higher presentation circulant blast cell percentage
		(p=0.030) as well as hyperleucocitosis (p=0.009). To identify those
		genes distinguishing the FLT3-ITD leukemic cells from FLT3-WT, we
		applied a Bayesian classifier. 147 genes, significantly different
		among classes based on t-tests, were selected and included into the
		classifier. Among them, 92 genes were up-regulated in FLT3-ITD class
		and 55 were down-regulated. FLT3 internal tandem duplication gene
		expression signature consisted of several high expressed genes, among
		them we found genes that are involved in cytoskeleton organization,
		cell adhesion and migration, in proliferation and
		coagulation/inflammation pathways as well as down-regulated genes of
		myeloid granules and differentiation suggesting a role of FLT3
		mutations in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestation of an APL
		subtype. SUPPLEMENTARY DATA:1) Anova gene list ITD, 2)Anova gene list

	<description>A data set of normal epithelium, serous ovarian surface
		epithelial-stromal tumors (benign and type II malignancies), stroma
		distal to tumor, and stroma adjacent to tumor (50 samples total).
		Additional cel files are included which represent replicate sampling
		from patients, and cel files that failed quality control but may be
		bioinformatically interesting. Additional replicate or failed cel
		files were not included in the final analysis (and so these samples
		were not included in the matrix). Background: Ovarian cancer is the
		most lethal gynecologic cancer in the United States. If caught in
		early stages, patient survival rate can reach 94%, when diagnosed at
		late stages survival rates drop to 28%. Correct diagnosis depends on
		the presence of definite symptoms: while ~90% of diagnosed ovarian
		cancers have symptoms, they tend to be unfocused and subacute. A
		definitive and early molecular signature of disease is thus desired.
		To further progress towards this goal, we present an
		Affymetrixâ&#132;¢ human exon array data set measuring ovarian tumor
		expression, assembled using best practices. Method: Samples were
		collected from patients with benign and malignant (type II) serous
		ovarian surface epithelial-stromal tumors. Normal epithelium, tumor,
		stroma adjacent to tumor, and distal stroma were selected based on
		histopathology, and isolated using laser capture microdissection.
		Nugen products were used to perform random-primed mRNA amplification
		procedures (for full transcript capture) before hybridization to
		Affymetrix exon chips. Tumor expression and paracrine signaling was
		assessed using GC-RMA and a two-way Model I ANOVA. Single enrichment
		ontological analysis and gene network construction were performed to
		guide inferences about biological context. Results: In total, across
		50 microarrays, ~270 million measurements were obtained. Based on
		comparisons to known ovarian cancer properties as established in
		molecular genetics literature, the initial analysis presented
		emphasizes data quality. Major trends between sample classes included:
		apical surface and tight junction activity, mitotic activity, benign
		tumor suppression, epithelial-mesenchymal transitioning, tumor
		oncogene activity, and paracrine signaling. A list of differentially
		expressed transcripts has been produced to enable rapid comparisons
		with published biomarker lists, but it is expected that detailed
		alternative transcript analysis will refine these predictions.
		Conclusions: A data set of 50 arrays, from carefully dissected serous
		ovarian surface epithelial-stromal tumors, has been produced, from
		which high quality measurements were obtained. While relatively small
		in number, this represents an important addition to the community pool
		of ovarian tumor samples, and the chosen platform enables bridging
		between 3' expression and exome sequencing data sets. This represents
		a significant contribution to the ovarian cancer genetics community. A
		total of 50 human ovary samples were used in analysis: 23 tissue
		samples laser capture microdissected from an ovary with a benign
		serous tumor (specifically 4 normal epithelium samples, 5 tumor
		samples, 6 stroma samples adjacent to the tumor, and 8 stroma samples
		distal of the tumor), and 27 tissue samples laser capture
		microdissected from an ovary with a malignant serous tumor
		(specifically 5 normal epithelium samples, 8 tumor samples, 7 stroma
		samples adjacent to the tumor, and 7 stroma samples distal of the
		tumor). Additional cel files were provided which, although were used
		in the quality control of the data set, were not used in the final
		experimental analysis. 8 replicates are included as cel files (1 from
		each cohort previously listed). 14 cel files were also included which
		failed quality control. Although the replicate and failed cel files
		were not used in the final analysis, they may still be interesting in
		other research.</description>

	<description>The cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase
		IDH1 is frequently mutated in human cancers. Recent studies have shown
		that IDH1 mutant primary glioblastomas (GBM) and acute myeloid
		leukemias (AML) display robust association with CpG island methylator
		phenotype (CIMP). Such observations bring into question whether IDH1
		mutations directly contribute to the development of CIMP or if the
		hypermethylation phenotype precedes acquisition of IDH1 mutations. To
		reveal the effects of IDH1 mutations on DNA methylation and gene
		expression, we introduced the most frequently observed IDH1 mutation,
		R132H, into a human cancer cell line through gene targeting. We
		profiled changes in methylation at over 27,000 CpG dinucleotides
		spanning 14,475 unique gene regions and characterized genome-wide gene
		expression alterations resulting from IDH1R132H knockin. We observed
		consistent changes in both DNA methylation and gene expression when
		comparing two independent IDH1R132H knockin clones to their wild-type
		parent, and report hypermethylation of over 2,000 loci, the majority
		of which contained preexisting methylation in IDH1WT parental cells.
		These loci exhibit the same trend in primary TCGA glioblastoma tumors
		with mutant IDH1 as compared to those with wild-type IDH1 and have
		significant overlap with genes hypermethylated in glioma-CIMP+ tumors.
		Furthermore, we identify specific DNA methylation and gene expression
		alterations which correlate with IDH1 mutations in our cell-line model
		as well as primary glioblastomas, including hypermethylation and
		transcriptional silencing of RBP1. The presented data provide insight
		on epigenetic alterations induced by IDH1 mutations and support a
		contributory role for IDH1 mutants in regulation of DNA methylation
		and gene expression in human cancer cells. Comparison of IDH1 R132H

	<description>Purpose: In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),
		approximately 25% of patients suffer from relapse. In recurrent
		disease, despite intensified therapy, overall cure rates of 40% remain
		unsatisfactory and survival rates are particularly poor in certain
		subgroups. The probability of long-term survival after relapse is
		predicted from well-established prognostic factors, i. e. time and
		site of relapse, immunophenotype and minimal residual disease.
		However, the underlying biological determinants of these prognostic
		factors remain poorly understood. Results: We show here that patients
		with very early relapse of ALL are characterized by a distinctive gene
		expression pattern. We identified a set of 83 genes differentially
		expressed in very early relapsed ALL compared to late relapsed
		disease. The vast majority of genes was up-regulated and many were
		late cell cycle genes with a function in mitosis. In addition, samples
		from patients with very early relapse showed a significant increase in
		the percentage of S and G/2M phase cells and this correlated well with
		the expression level of cell cycle genes. Conclusions: Very early
		relapse of ALL is characterized by an increased proliferative capacity
		of leukemic blasts and up-regulated mitotic genes. The latter suggests
		that novel drugs, targeting late cell cycle proteins, might be
		beneficial for these patients that typically face a dismal prognosis.
		Experiment Overall Design: We performed gene expression profiling on
		60 prospectively collected samples of children with first relapse of
		acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled on the relapse trial ALL-REZ BFM
		2002 of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster study group.</description>

	<description>Increasing studies suggest that SALL4 may play vital roles
		in leukemogenesis. We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed
		by microarray hybridization as a screening tool to determine potential
		genes that may account for the role SALL4 plays in leukemogenesis.
		Analysis of SALL4 binding sites reveals that genes involved in cell
		death, cancer, DNA replication/repair, and cell cycle were highly
		enriched (p&lt;0.05). These genes include 38 important
		apoptosis-inducing genes (TNF, TP53, PTEN, CARD9, CARD11, CYCS, LTA)
		and apoptosis-inhibiting genes (Bmi-1, BCL2, XIAP, DAD1, TEGT).
		Real-time PCR has shown that expression levels of these genes changed
		significantly after SALL4 knockdown, which ubiquitously led to cell
		apoptosis. Flow cytometry revealed that reduction of SALL4 expression
		in NB4 and other leukemia cell lines dramatically increased caspase-3,
		Annexin V, and DNA fragmentation activity.
		Bromodeoxyuridine-incorporation assays showed decreased numbers of S
		phase cells and increased numbers of G1- and G2- phase cells
		indicating reduced DNA synthesis, consistent with results from cell
		proliferation assays. In addition, NB4 cells that express low levels
		of SALL4 have significantly decreased tumorigenecity in
		immunodeficient mice. Our studies provide a foundation in the
		development of leukemia stem cell-specific therapy by targeting SALL4.
		Keywords: ChIP-chip The global targets of SALL4 were determined using
		a NimbleGen promoter tiling array (2.7kb, information below) in the
		human cell line NB4. Because SALL4 is thought to play a significant
		role in leukemogenesis we focused primarily on genes involved in
		apoptosis and only used the ChIP-chip array as a screening tool to
		identify potential genes that may bind these genes. Upon
		identification and verification of apoptosis genes bound by SALL4 we
		utilized functional assays to determine the effect of SALL4 on these
		genes. In addition, gene expression profiling was used to determine
		pathways functionally altered by Sall4 reduction. Source: UCSC Build:

	<description>Highly rearranged and mutated cancer genomes present major
		challenges in the identification of pathogenetic events driving the
		cancer process. Here, we engineered lymphoma-prone mice with
		chromosomal instability to assess the utility of mouse models in
		cancer gene discovery and the extent of cross-species overlap in
		cancer-associated copy number aberrations. Integrating with targeted
		re-sequencing, our comparative oncogenomic studies efficiently
		identified FBXW7 and PTEN as commonly deleted or mutated tumor
		suppressors in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma
		(T-ALL). More generally, the murine cancers acquire widespread
		recurrent clonal amplifications and deletions targeting loci syntenic
		to alterations present in not only human T-ALL but also diverse tumors
		of hematopoietic, mesenchymal and epithelial types. These results thus
		support the view that murine and human tumors experience common
		biological processes driven by orthologous genetic events as they
		evolve towards a malignant phenotype. The highly concordant nature of
		genomic events encourages the use of genome unstable murine cancer

	<description>A part of current research has intensively been focused on
		the proliferation and metabolic processes governing biological
		systems. Since the advent of high throughput methodologies like
		microarrays, the load of genomic data has increased geometrically and
		along with that the need for computational methods which will
		interpret these data. In the present work we study in vitro the common
		proliferation and metabolic processes, which are combined to the
		common oncogenic pathways, as far as gene expression is concerned,
		between the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CCRF-CEM) and the
		rhabdomyosarcoma (TE-671) cell lines. We present a computational
		approach, using cDNA microarrays, in order to identify commonalities
		between diverse biological systems. Our analysis predicted that JAK1,
		STAT1, PIAS2 and CDK4 are the driving forces in the two cell lines.
		This type of analysis can lead to the understanding of the common
		mechanisms that transform physiological cells to malignant, as well as
		it reveals a new holistic way to understandthe the dynamics of tumor
		onset as well as the mechanistics of oncogenic drivers. The present
		work is concerned with the common expressional profile of two cell
		lines: the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CCRF-CEM) and the
		rhabdomyosarcoma (TE-671) cell lines. Our investigation was focused on
		the identification of genes that share a common expression profile
		between the two cell lines. Both cell lines are characterized by the
		fact that their differentiation has stopped at an early stage, before
		they mature to their final cell type. Normally, these cells would have
		matured and progressed into differentiated cells, constituting blood
		and muscle cells, respectively. At some unknown point, normal
		differentiation ceased for these cells and they became malignant. From
		that point on, to the first manifestation of symptoms of malignancy,
		there is a lack of knowledge regarding the mechanisms underlying
		oncogenesis. From these observations, the question whether two
		distinct cell types destined to fulfill different functions, manifest
		similar mechanisms of growth and progression due to their malignant
		character, arises. The present study was focused on the identification
		of the differential expression profiles underlying the two cell lines.
		A previous report studied the expression profile of seven ARMS cell
		lines possessing the PAX3-FKHR fusion gene, along with other cell
		lines of different tumor types (22). To our knowledge, this is the
		first time that a comparison between two totally different types of
		neoplasia, such as the CCRF-CEM and TE-671 cell lines, is attempted.
		These mechanisms are examined with purpose to identify common drivers
		that lead to the progression of tumor cells. We hereby propose a new
		computational approach for the investigation of common oncogenic
		drivers.</description>

	<description>We evaluated gene expression changes in secondary
		recipient murine leukemia caused by retroviral overexpression of
		MLL-AF9. We compared wild-type (WT) leukemia cells with mutant
		leukemia cells after cre-mediated inactivation of a homozygous
		conditional allele for Ezh2, a component of the Polycomb Repressive
		Complex2. For WT cells, 4 biological replicates were hybridized. For
		Ezh2-null cells, 5 biological replicates were hybridized.
